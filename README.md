# ScratchMap
ScratchMap is a hacktathon project that I coded alongside 4 other people during the Multisynq 2024 hackathon. This project was awarded second place.

ScratchMap is the easiest way to coordinate ad hoc location-based events with groups of people. In one click you can create a map and get a custom link and QR code to send to friends and strangers and give everyone the ability to add pins and notes. Itâ€™s perfect for coordinating group dinners, excursions and ad hoc meetups at conferences and festivals. Try it yourself below.
